## 🧾 Problem Statement

Given an array `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `i`-th paper, return their **H-index**.

### ℹ️ What is H-index?
The **H-index** is defined as the *maximum number `h` such that the researcher has at least `h` papers with `h` or more citations*.

## 🧠 Thought Process / Intuition

1. I first understood the H-index definition with an example:
   - If a researcher has citation counts: `[3, 0, 6, 1, 5]`
   - Sort this descending → `[6, 5, 3, 1, 0]`
   - Now, go index by index:
     - At index `0`, citations = `6`, `h = 1` → valid
     - At index `1`, citations = `5`, `h = 2` → valid
     - At index `2`, citations = `3`, `h = 3` → valid
     - At index `3`, citations = `1`, `h = 4` → fails
   - So the H-index = 3

2. The key idea:
   - Sort the array descending.
   - Loop through and stop when `citations[i] < i + 1`.

---

## ✅ Final Approach

### Strategy:
- Sort the citations in **descending** order.
- Loop over the sorted list.
- Compare `citations[i]` with `i + 1` (because array is 0-based but `h` starts at 1).
- If at any point `citations[i] < i + 1`, return `i`.

### 💡 Why just `<` and not `<=`?
- Because we want **at least `h` papers with citations ≥ `h`**.
- So, as long as citations are **≥ `i + 1`**, the condition holds.
- When it becomes strictly **less than `i + 1`**, the condition breaks.

## 💻 C++ Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        sort(citations.begin(), citations.end(), greater<int>());
        for (int i = 0; i < citations.size(); i++) {
            if (citations[i] < i + 1)
                return i;
        }
        return citations.size();
    }
};
