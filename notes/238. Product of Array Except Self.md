## üßæ Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the **product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`**.

You must solve it in **O(n)** time and **without using division**.

---

## üß™ Examples

```
Input:  nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: [24, 12, 8, 6]

Input:  nums = [-1, 1, 0, -3, 3]
Output: [0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
```

## ü§î My Initial Thought (Why it Doesn't Work)

My first idea:

- Take the product of all elements in the array.
- Then for each index `i`, compute `answer[i] = total_product / nums[i]`.

### üîç Example:
```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
total = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
answer = [24/1, 24/2, 24/3, 24/4] = [24, 12, 8, 6]
```

### üö´ Why this fails:
- Division is **not allowed** by the problem constraints.
- If there are **zeroes** in the array, the total product becomes 0 and division by zero will break the logic.

## ‚úÖ Optimal Approach (Prefix & Suffix Product ‚Äì 2 Pass Algorithm)

### üîÑ Strategy:
- We will **avoid division** by using **two passes**:
  - One pass to compute **prefix products**.
  - Another to compute **suffix products**.
- For each element, the result is:  
  `answer[i] = prefix[i] * suffix[i]`

### üë£ Step-by-step:
1. Create an output array `answer` of size `n` and initialize all values as `1`.
2. Do a **left-to-right** pass:
   - At each index `i`, store the product of all elements to the **left** of `i`.
3. Do a **right-to-left** pass:
   - Multiply each index with the product of all elements to the **right** of `i`.

## üíª C++ Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> answer(n, 1);

        int prefix = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            answer[i] = prefix;
            prefix *= nums[i];
        }

        int suffix = 1;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            answer[i] *= suffix;
            suffix *= nums[i];
        }

        return answer;
    }
};
```

## üß† Explanation of Code

- `prefix` starts at 1. As we go from left to right:
  - For each `i`, we store the product of all elements before it.
- `suffix` also starts at 1. As we go from right to left:
  - For each `i`, we multiply what's already in `answer[i]` with the product of elements after it.

This way:
- `answer[i] = (product of elements before i) * (product of elements after i)`

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra space (excluding output array)
