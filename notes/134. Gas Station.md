# 🚗 LeetCode 134 – Gas Station (C++)

## 🔗 Problem Link:
[LeetCode 134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

---

## 🧠 Problem Summary

You are given two integer arrays:
- `gas[i]`: amount of gas available at station `i`
- `cost[i]`: gas required to travel from station `i` to `(i + 1)`

The route is **circular**. You must find a **starting station index** such that you can travel the **entire circuit once** in a clockwise direction **without running out of gas**.

If no such index exists, return `-1`.

📌 If a solution exists, it is **guaranteed to be unique**.

---

## ✅ Key Observations

- At each station, calculate the **net gain/loss** of gas:  
  `diff = gas[i] - cost[i]`

- **Total gas** across all stations must be **greater than or equal to** total cost, or else it's impossible to finish:
  ```cpp
  if (total gas < total cost) → return -1;
  ```

---

## 🔍 Greedy Solution Explanation

We simulate the journey with:
- `total` → total net gas across all stations
- `tank` → current gas level in the tank during the simulation
- `start` → index from where we attempt to start the journey

If at any point `tank` becomes negative, it means:
- We cannot start from current `start`
- We **move start to the next station**
- Reset tank to 0

---

## ✅ C++ Code (Greedy + Efficient)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int total = 0;
        int tank = 0;
        int start = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < gas.size(); ++i) {
            int diff = gas[i] - cost[i];
            total += diff;
            tank += diff;

            if (tank < 0) {
                start = i + 1; // can't start from current station
                tank = 0;      // reset tank
            }
        }

        return total >= 0 ? start : -1;
    }
};
```

## 🧪 Dry Run Example

```cpp
gas  =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
cost = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2];
```

Start at index `3`:
- tank = 0 + 4 → 4
- go to station 4: 4 - 1 + 5 → 8
- go to station 0: 8 - 2 + 1 → 7
- go to station 1: 7 - 3 + 2 → 6
- go to station 2: 6 - 4 + 3 → 5
- go back to station 3: 5 - 5 = 0 ✅

Output: `3`

## ❓ Why Use `++i` Instead of `i++`?

In `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)`:
- `++i` (pre-increment) is **slightly more efficient** than `i++` (post-increment) because it doesn't create a temporary copy.
- It's a **good habit**, especially when working with iterators or custom types.
